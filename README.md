# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# From Nico
In order to prepare for my Nucamp Bootcamp React portion, I decided to watch Clever Programming's Todo Web App tutorial. The purpose of this tutorial was to start becoming familar with components, states, and hooks and see how they work together to produce a tangible product. What was great was learning about firebase and how I can use their database and hosting services as my backend while I was building the frontend of my app.

The Todo App has full CRUD functionality! Check it out below!.

As I start working through Nucamp's React portion of the course and pick up key concepts, I will make changes to the frontend and make this app look pretty.
